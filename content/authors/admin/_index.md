I am a first-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/), working on AI systems. I also have the fortune to work with [Prof. Tianqi Chen](https://tqchen.com/) as part of the [Catalyst Group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/).

I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Tianqi Chen and collaborated with [Prof. Zhihao Jia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/).

I focus on systems problem in emerging machine learning workloads, with various open-source
development experience. I am the lead of [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) and a core contributor to [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).

I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Operations Research from Cornell University,
where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christopher De Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa/) on distributed training and with [Prof. Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/) on reinforcement learning and stochastic processes.
