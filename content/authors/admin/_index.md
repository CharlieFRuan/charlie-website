I am a first-year MSCS student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Tianqi Chen](https://tqchen.com/) as part of the [Catalyst Group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/).

My focus is at the intersection of machine learning and systems, with various open-source
development experience. I am the current lead of [Web LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm), a core contributor to [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm), and have
been contributing to [ApacheTVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm). I also contributed to [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) as part of
Google's TF Runtime team in Summer 2023.

Prior to coming to CMU, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Operations Research from Cornell University,
where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Christopher De Sa](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cdesa/) on distributed ML and with [Prof. Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/) on reinforcement learning.
